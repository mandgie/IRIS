# Goal Agent

An AI-powered agent that helps achieve long-term goals through continuous monitoring, analysis, and adaptive interventions.

## Current Implementation

### Core Components
- **Agent System**: Core decision-making system that analyzes situations and takes appropriate actions
- **Memory System**: SQLite-based persistent storage for decisions, notes, and historical analysis
- **Tools System**: Extensible framework for different types of actions
  - Note Taking Tool: For storing and retrieving information
  - Calculator Tool: For numerical analysis

### Features
- Hourly decision cycles with adaptive check intervals
- Persistent memory storage with SQLite
- Pattern recognition and analysis
- Time-based summaries (daily, weekly, monthly)
- XML-based communication with LLM (Google Gemini)

## Upcoming Features

### Short Term
1. **New Tools**
   - Calendar integration for scheduling training sessions
   - Weather tool for checking running conditions
   - Progress tracking tool for logging runs
   - Health metrics tool for monitoring recovery

2. **Enhanced Memory System**
   - Better pattern recognition
   - Long-term trend analysis
   - More sophisticated importance scoring
   - Memory compression for efficient storage

3. **Improved Decision Making**
   - Context-aware action selection
   - Multi-step planning
   - Priority-based scheduling
   - Risk assessment for actions

### Medium Term
1. **User Interface**
   - Web dashboard for monitoring agent activity
   - Interactive tool configuration
   - Progress visualization
   - Real-time agent communication

2. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Fitness app integration (Strava, Garmin, etc.)
   - Smart device connectivity
   - External APIs for weather, traffic, etc.
   - Calendar systems integration

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - ML-based pattern recognition
   - Predictive analysis for goal progress
   - Adaptive goal adjustment
   - Performance optimization suggestions

### Long Term
1. **Multi-Goal Management**
   - Handle multiple concurrent goals
   - Resource allocation between goals
   - Goal priority management
   - Conflict resolution

2. **Collaborative Features**
   - Multi-agent coordination
   - Shared knowledge base
   - Community goal templates
   - Expert system integration

3. **Autonomous Optimization**
   - Self-improving decision strategies
   - Automated tool selection
   - Dynamic resource allocation
   - Adaptive intervention timing
