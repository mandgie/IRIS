DECISION SUMMARY
2025-01-15 07:33:12 | INFO | --------------------------------------------------
2025-01-15 07:33:12 | INFO | Analysis: The goal is to complete a marathon in under 3 hours by 2025-12-31.  It is currently January 15th, 2025.  There are almost 12 months to prepare. The success criteria include a weekly mileage of 50 miles and a long run of 20 miles.  Currently, there is no training plan in place.
2025-01-15 07:33:12 | INFO | Decision: Action
2025-01-15 07:33:12 | INFO | Reasoning: A training plan is crucial for achieving the marathon goal.  A first step is to create a note outlining a preliminary training schedule. This will serve as a starting point for achieving the required weekly mileage and long-run distance.
